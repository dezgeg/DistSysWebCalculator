Distributed Systems project: Multitier architectures in the Web.

Server side
===========
All the server side code is in server.php.
It either does the calculations, with the GET parameters specified in the spec (arg1, op, arg2),
or if the 'plot' parameter is given, plots that expression.
The expression should be a valid gnuplot expression, and if valid,
a PNG file is directly output.

Simple client
=============
Open client0.html for the two input boxes, one combo box-version.

The history is implemented with HTML5 local storage,
the calculations are stored as strings in an JSONified
array in the local storage, and displayed as simple
divs.

Complex client
==============
The complex client first parses the expression into RPN (parse() in js/parse.js),
and then it can be evaluated in that form directly (evalExpr() in js/parse.js).
It accepts expressions as in the spec, but additionally the sin and cos
functions can be used in normal calculations too.

The RPN evaluator also takes a calculator function that implements the actual
calculations. There are three calculation functions (js/calculate.js):
    - completely local calculation
    - server-side elementary calculations
    - server-side calculation, with results added to the calculation history view

The plain calculation uses the last one. Local plotting uses the two first ones.
For the server calculations, sine is approximated with taylor series for
the range -pi;pi, and other values are calculated by reducing the
argument into that range. Cos is implemented with sin.

The plotting can be done on client or on the server.
Use the combobox to choose.
Arbitrary expressions can be plotted. (i.e 1 + 1/x)
Plotting is activated if the variable x occurs in the expression.

Server-side plotting is just gnuplot outputting a PNG image.

The client-side plotter evaluates the RPN expression repeatedly (evalExpr())
with different values of x, and plots them to a canvas.
The plotting is done inside a setTimeout callback with a delay of 0,
to prevent browser death.

Installation
============
None, just unpack to a PHP-enabled web server.
On users at http://tmtynkky.users.cs.helsinki.fi/distsys/

jQuery is used from the CDN.
